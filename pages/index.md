hyperlink.academy is an online university that lives in the links between
personal websites. Here we learn about the internet.

The structure is simple. The academy has 6-week long semesters. Anyone is
welcome to enroll and anyone can facilliate a course on anything related to the
internet (programming, communities, hardware, music, anything).

If you complete at least 1 course during a semester, you **graduate** and get a
~sticker~.


## Upcoming: [Semester 0](/semester/0)

**Starts Monday October 14, 2019**

Since this is the first semester, we won't have an
orientation week, but a Orientation Day, Friday September 27th starting with a
video call at 10AM EST. Meet [here](https://meet.jit.si/hyperlink-academy).

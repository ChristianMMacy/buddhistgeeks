hyperlink.academy is an online university that lives in the links between
personal websites. Here we learn about the internet.

The structure is simple. The academy has 6-week long semesters. Anyone is
welcome to enroll and anyone can facilliate a course on anything related to the
internet (programming, communities, hardware, music, anything).

If you complete at least 1 course during a semester, you **graduate** and get a
~sticker~.

## Experiments with Learning Clubs

Hyperlink is built to support the sort of courses we want to see more of — small cohorts of learners, guided by a curriculum and facilitator, exploring a specific topic together.

Now we're trying a slightly different format for group learning: **Clubs**.

Our mission is to support a broad spectrum of powerful learning experiences. With Clubs we want to create spaces for a type of experience that's not *quite* so structured, and leans more to the peer-to-peer end of the spectrum.

Here's more about what we have in mind, followed by examples of learning-focused Clubs we think could work well for this format.

## What Do We Mean by "Club"?

Like courses:

- **Small group:** a cohort actively exploring a specific topic, project, or question
- **Facilitated:** someone organizes and leads; not purely P2P
- **Serialized:** more than a single meeting
- **Predictable commitment:** fixed length, regular schedule

Unlike courses:

- **Loose structure:** don't need a curriculum; more emergent and participant-driven
- **One-time:** can run once, rather than in multiple cohorts; doesn't require long-term maintenance
- **More casual goal:** less concern with specific objectives or legible artifacts

Clubs are intended to support focused series' of communal learning events — a way to make and learn interesting things together, while providing a flexible, sustainable model for such groups to succeed.

Here are some ideas for Clubs we think could be amazing on Hyperlink:

## Reading Groups

The book club: a classic type of small group learning club! How can we make them a bit more structured and rigorous?

- **Serious introduction to a field:** diving into a new area together — say, library and information science, or history and theory of pedagogy, or deep ecology. Participants might choose a few books to read together, or go through an anthology or textbook.
- **Big challenging books:** some books are tough to tackle on your own, and/or simply much more rewarding when read with a group. Books like [GEB](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24113.G_del_Escher_Bach), [SICP](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43713.Structure_and_Interpretation_of_Computer_Programs), [APL](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/79766.A_Pattern_Language) (or others without iconic acronyms!)
- **Silent reading club:** time and space to read, together — a kind of virtual reading retreat with friends, whether or not you're all reading the same books
- **Journal or paper clubs:** digging into papers or essays on a particular topic
- **Book show and tells:** for example, an antilibrary show and tell, where each participant talks about a few of their top unread books

## Creator Circles

Working groups for artists, writers, and other creators, focused on exchanging useful feedback and helping each other make great work.

- **Art critique groups:** for example a drawing club, where artists meet together over a series of sessions to draw together and exchange feedback
- **Writing groups:** time for writing and exchanging feedback with a peer group of other writers
- **Focused work groups:** people getting together regularly to work on their projects, e.g. everyone launching their own newsletter, or a Kickstarter campaign, together

## Communities of Practice

Peers with similar interests, work, or hobbies, convening to explore it together.

- **Language learning:** people learning the same language, or each other's native languages, doing conversational practice together
- **Peer professional development:** people in similar roles (e.g. UX designers, developers, or PMs) but at different companies, learning from each other
- **Indie mastermind:** independent creators or consultants in the same niche, hacking on projects together and/or exchanging ideas, feedback, and accountability

## Academic-Adjacent

- **Generative learning events:** bringing together people in diverse fields to collaboratively explore something together…perhaps a series or "season" of related events
- **Distributed micro-conference (or unconference):** a series of events where participants collectively get a deep introduction to a body of thought or particular influential thinkers
- **Research group:** working group for a particular research project (art, science, culture, you name it)

## Fun!

- **Puzzle solving club:** solving a series of puzzles together, a la the MIT Mystery Hunt
- **Movie watching club:** participants could watch the entire filmography of an influential director, or dive deep on the cinema of a certain country, genre, or other canon
- **Music listening club:** listen to and analyze classic albums together, from a particular artist or genre
- **Fandoms:** write fan-fiction, discuss obscure theories, explore the canon(and fanon)

## Propose a Club on Hyperlink!

If you're interested in running a Club, we'd love to hear what you have in mind! Please fill out this form with a few quick questions:

### [Hyperlink - Request for Learning Clubs](https://hyperlink.academy/forms/propose-club)

**UPDATE: We'll be announcing an initial lineup of Clubs in mid-October. To be part of that launch announcement, please submit your idea by Sunday, October 11.**

(After is fine if you want to try a club later on, we'll likely do rolling launches after this initial batch.)

Rough ideas welcome; we're happy to chat more about the details. Look forward to hearing from you!

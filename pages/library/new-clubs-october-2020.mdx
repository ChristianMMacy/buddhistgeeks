**Now on Hyperlink: our first batch of Learning Clubs!**

Similar to Courses, Clubs are a format for learning with ***small groups***, actively ***facilitated***, on ***niche topics***.

But they're also: more ***casual***, more ***exploratory***, and more ***peer-driven***. 

Think: book club, research group, art critique cohort — people creating their own structures to learn together in a focused way.

We're excited to announce our initial batch of eight Clubs, spanning a wide range of topics and formats. 

Take a look and consider joining!


## Learning Clubs

Open for enrollment: clubs on indie research and planetary studies; clubs exploring museums, media futures, blue humanities; clubs to share art, desserts, rhymes…

⬇️ ⬇️ ⬇️ 

### [How To Build A Habitable Planet](https://hyperlink.academy/courses/book-club-on-how-to-build-a-habitable-planet/44/cohorts/37)

*Facilitated by Krish | Starts Oct 31*

We'll be reading How To Build A Habitable Planet, exploring the geological, environmental, and historical-physical foundations our lives are based upon — and learning to view the world differently.


### [House of Interdisciplinary Autodidacts](https://hyperlink.academy/courses/house-of-interdisciplinary-autodidacts/42/cohorts/35)

*Facilitated by Vinay | Starts Nov 1*

Join fellow autodidacts to explore intriguing interdisciplinary questions together and to learn the secrets of leveraging the web for more professional autonomy and free-agency.


### [Breaking (and Remaking) News](https://hyperlink.academy/courses/breaking-and-remaking-news/41/cohorts/41)

*Facilitated by Jasmine | Starts Nov 8*

A structured reading and brainstorming group about the past/future of news media, centering the book Breaking News by Alan Rusbridger.


### [Literature at Sea: A Brief History of Existence](https://hyperlink.academy/courses/literature-at-sea-a-brief-history-of-existence/39/cohorts/34)

*Facilitated by Timothy | Starts Nov 9*

Vitally important to human existence (and perhaps foundational to all matter) is the sea, of which we know relatively little. Take an imaginative deep dive into this space through literature.


### [The Artist's Critique Circle](https://hyperlink.academy/courses/the-artists-critique-circle/45/cohorts/36)

*Facilitated by Kinjal | Starts Nov 10*

Weekly artist's forum to learn from each other, receive feedback, and share techniques. We'll explore a series of open prompts, followed by thoughtful critique and commentary among peers.


### [Rhyme Writing Roundtable](https://hyperlink.academy/courses/rhyme-writing-roundtable/36/cohorts/30)

*Facilitated by Brendan | Starts Nov 20*

A late night lyricism lounge; a friendly rap-writing critique club; a space for poetic play. Each meeting will be half group-writing session + half feedback session.


### [International Confectionaries](https://hyperlink.academy/courses/international-confectionaries/43/cohorts/33)

*Facilitated by Celine | Starts Nov 29*

Every week we will make a different confectionery together! We will try to focus on desserts with diverse origins. Halva, Baklava, Mochi, Flan, Sfenj, Mooncakes, Jalebis, Yuuuuuuuuum~


### [Virtual Museum Explorer Club](https://hyperlink.academy/courses/virtual-museum-explorer-club/38/cohorts/31)

*Facilitated by Jinjin | Starts Nov 30*

We'll go on tours via scavenger hunt through the virtual collections of world-class art museums.


## Create a Course or Club?

If you'd like to propose either a Course or a Club to run on Hyperlink, we'd love to hear from you.

For a club, just fill out this form, and we'll get back to you:

- [Propose a Club](https://hyperlink.academy/forms/propose-club)

If you're more interested in doing a course, good news — we've scheduled a new cohort of the [Meta Course](https://hyperlink.academy/courses/the-meta-course/1), our own course creation workshop.

If you have a course idea, please tell us about it here:

- [Propose a Course](https://hyperlink.academy/forms/propose-course)

We can chat more and invite you to the Meta Course if it seems like a good fit!

This next cohort starts on Sunday, Nov. 1 at 1pm ET, and runs for 5 weeks. It's free, just requires commitment to attend the meetings, and interest in developing a course on Hyperlink.

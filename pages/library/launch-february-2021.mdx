Hyperlink's latest batch of learning is here! An awesome array of courses, clubs, and events…AKA a **knowledge drop**, if you will.

We're moving to monthly launches — so you can expect another update at the same time next month.

## Meta Course + Departments

We've got two more cohorts of the Meta Course starting this month — and we're trying something new, with themed cohorts, anticipating our development of Hyperlink __Departments__.

These aren't quite open for enrollment yet, but we're planning:

- **Meta Course - Visual Thinking** (e.g. comics, design, art, video, animation) starting Thurs. Feb 18.
- **Meta Course - Language Arts** (e.g. linguistics, writing, rhetoric) starting Sat. Feb 27.

As always, you can submit ideas for courses (to develop in the Meta Course) and clubs (to try any time) here: [courses](https://hyperlink.academy/forms/propose-course) + [clubs](https://hyperlink.academy/forms/propose-club).

If you have an idea you think would be a good fit for one of the themed Meta Courses above, let us know!

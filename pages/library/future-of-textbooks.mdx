This past weekend, we hosted a roundtable discussion exploring the future of textbooks.

While our focus at Hyperlink is on live, interactive learning experiences, the content that supports these experiences — lesson plans, readings, worksheets, assignments, artifacts and more — is also important, and ripe with all sorts of possibilities for further experimentation.

Already, we're seeing a number of course creators exploring interesting ways to create and share learning materials, from '[micro-textbooks](https://hyperlink.academy/courses/write-a-micro-textbook/14)' to [dual-publishing workflows](https://hyperlink.academy/courses/the-book-is-a-program/21) for web + print output to iteratively developed texts for [specific courses](https://hyperlink.academy/courses/language-construction-workshop/26).

We wanted to explore questions like:

- How can textbooks connect to social learning experiences?
- How can textbooks respond to the needs of individual learners?
- How can learners contribute to / manipulate / diverge from a textbook?
- How can learning materials adapt across workflows, branches and forks
- How can we create stronger shared contexts for reading and writing?

Here are our notes from the session — we covered quite a lot in an hour! — plus a collection of links and projects for further perusal.

Show and tell:

- Lester talked about his data science research and how he's trying to identify digital textbook content to run NLP models on
- Colin showed us the conlang textbook he's writing with LaTeX and PDF, touching on linguistics-specific workflow challenges
- Frode gave an overview of his work with augmented text tools, including affordances for inline references, and "visual-meta" for metadata + structural data
- Max showed an awesome list he made of "e-texts", as well as introduced us to the "ScholarPhi" project for interactive display of math equations

Interesting topics we touched on:

- The "open educational resources" movement; open source textbooks
- Publishing as an evolving process, and possibilities for "phases" e.g. transitioning from an open and fluid text to a more solid bounded artifact
- Authority; the "finished" nature of textbooks… What happens to books over time? What books are canonical, and how do such definitions change?
- How textbooks can be made or conceived of as more interactive, e.g. prompting and incorporating student artifacts as examples in various contexts
- How we define a "textbook" in the first place; what distinguishes a textbook from other books, wikis, or other texts and resources used for learning?
- How textbooks might fit into our antilibraries
- The changing nature of the syllabus, from shared context to multi-directional or group-annotated source
- Environments for sharing structured data, from LaTeX to JSON to the clipboard

Examples:

- [Andy Matuschak's work](https://andymatuschak.org); "mnemonic media" and "timeful texts"; experiments with Michael Nielsen
- Interactive online or app-based textbooks like [Mathigon](https://mathigon.org) and [Open Music Theory](http://openmusictheory.com/)
- Free, open online textbooks e.g. [OpenStax](https://openstax.org/subjects)
- This very intriguing *hyperreadings* [essay](https://samiz-dat.github.io/hyperreadings/) + [platform](http://hyperreadings.info/)
- Open source academic publishing platforms e.g. [Manifold](https://manifoldapp.org/learn), [Pressbooks](https://pressbooks.com/), [PubPub](https://www.pubpub.org/)
- Networked versions of classic books e.g. [Roam Library](https://roamlibrary.com/library)
- Various other web-published books, as in [books that are websites](https://www.are.na/callum-flack/books-that-are-websites) Arena collection
- Frode's [Augmented Text Tools](https://www.augmentedtext.info/) and [Visual-Meta](http://visual-meta.info/)
- [ScholarPhi](https://scholarphi.org/), aiming to augment technical papers with contextual meanings of terms and symbols
- Max's great [collection of e-texts](https://raindrop.io/collection/11829853)
- Kathleen Fitzpatrick's [Planned Obsolescence: Publishing, Technology, and the Future of the Academy](http://mcpress.media-commons.org/plannedobsolescence/), one of the first open textbooks, open for comments and annotations before an eventual printed edition
- The [IndieWeb "book" page](https://indieweb.org/book), with some more great references
- The [Chinese Text Project](https://ctext.org/), an open-access digital library for pre-modern Chinese texts
- [Syllabit](https://syllabit.com/), a mobile-friendly platform for creating and sharing a syllabus
- Publishing workflows with peer review / social annotation, e.g. [Annotation](https://mitpressonpubpub.mitpress.mit.edu/annotation) by Remi Kalir and Antero Garcia, using PubPub; see also [Hypothes.is](https://web.hypothes.is/)
- [Telescopic Text](https://www.telescopictext.org/), a tool for creating expanding texts (nice example: [Writing](https://overland.org.au/media/writing/))
- [Templating for Lawyers](https://writing.kemitchell.com/2021/03/13/Templating-for-Lawyers.html) blog post by Kyle Mitchell
- [Arbital](https://arbital.com/), a blogging / wiki platform with some interesting features
- Examples of mungers for text transformation: [Unmung](http://www.unmung.com/); [Bible Munger](https://biblemunger.micahrl.com/munge); [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/index.html)
- Craig Mod's [Post Artifact Books and Publishing](https://craigmod.com/journal/post_artifact/)
- Remi Kalir's [Annotate Your Syllabus 3.0](https://remikalir.com/blog/annotate-your-syllabus-3-0/) blog post (and two previous ones!)

Let's continue the conversation. We've opened a discussion on the Hyperlink forum — we'd love to see any follow up questions, additional examples, proposals, open problems, or other ideas.

In particular:

- How can facilitators and learners play with these ideas on Hyperlink?
- How best can we help support that?

We look forward to exploring these topics further!

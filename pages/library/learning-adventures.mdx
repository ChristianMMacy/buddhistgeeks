Here at Hyperlink we're packing bags, buying provisions, setting up base camp — getting ready for an experimental expedition:

**Learning Adventures.**

Do you have a personal learning project you'd love to complete this year?

Often the hardest part about learning outside of a full time institutional environment (read: school) isn't deciding *what* you want to learn — but the motivation to actually do it, and a support network to help keep you focused and accountable.

We're experimenting with [Learning Adventures](https://hyperlink.academy/courses/hyperlink-learning-adventure-club/76) as a peer-driven learning club on Hyperlink.

- *Independent learning — with a community of peers.*
- *Your own project and goals — with social accountability.*

We think this will be a lot of fun — a great way to take a project to the next level, give it more shape and momentum, and generate concrete, shareable artifacts based on what you learn.

Our first cohort starts **Monday, Feb 1**. To join, [propose an adventure](https://hyperlink.academy/forms/propose-adventure) by **Wednesday, Jan 27**. Details below.

## What Kinds of *Adventures*?

You might be working on an **ambitious project** — writing a book, doing a long-term research project, building experimental software. For example:

- Nadia's research on open source communities, leading to her book [Working in Public](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54140556-working-in-public)
- Andy's work creating [tools for thought](https://www.patreon.com/quantumcountry) and experimenting with long-form writing and spaced repetition

You might be taking a **creative practice** to the next level — your own version of something like NaNoWriMo or the 100 Day Project. For example:

- Jinjin's 2+ year series of [100 self-portraits](https://twitter.com/i/events/1281712477798125568) inserted into classic works from art history
- Malavika's month-long project [practicing animation techniques](https://www.instagram.com/malavikainmotion/) by emulating favorite artists

You might be doing **focused reading or study** — going deep on a challenging text, open source curriculum, or self-created reading list. For example:

- Brendan wants to understand the foundations of library and information science, so he plans to go through an introductory textbook
- Malavika wants to learn new 3D animation software by completing a series of online tutorials and exercises

One other category of adventure we're very interested in: **projects that explore ideas you're interested in teaching**.

Any of the above adventures could be done with an eye towards building a curriculum to teach others. We want to encourage this, and open the possibility of using Learning Adventures as a kind of pre-Meta Course process to seed ideas for future teaching. To encourage this:

**If you turn your project into a Hyperlink course or club in the next six months, we'll refund the cost of this adventure cohort.**

## Agenda

Here's what each participant will do in our month-long cohort:

- Create a learning plan
- Share our progress in group show and tells
- Check in 1:1 with accountability partners
- Join optional group co-working sessions
- Create final artifacts to share what we learn

## Details & Logistics

- [Brendan](https://hyperlink.academy/people/brendan) will facilitate this beta cohort, starting **February 1**
- This cohort will meet on **Mondays at noon EST** — let us know when you apply if you'd like to join for February, or a future cohort
- Beta pricing is **$25 for the month** (in the future it will likely be $50+)
- Commit for one month at a time; join again in a future cohort to continue with a longer project
- To get the most out of this, we suggest applying with a fairly well-defined project that you've already started to explore, taking it from initial "discovery phase" to a focused and structured "build phase"

## How to Join

[Propose an adventure here](https://hyperlink.academy/forms/propose-adventure)

- Please submit by **Wednesday, Jan 27** (rolling deadline)
- We'll get back to you by **Friday Jan 29** and invite you to enroll before our first call on **Monday, Feb 1**

Please [let us know](mailto:contact@hyperlink.academy) if you have any questions, or ideas for things we should try in this cohort! This is very much an experiment and we plan to iterate and improve as we go; we'd love to hear suggestions.

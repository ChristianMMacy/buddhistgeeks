## Facillitating a course

So you want to facillitate a course! Awesome! 

You may have noticed this is a fairly open-ended space, so all sorts of courses
are welcome. You could teach a class, or moderate a recurring discussion, or run
an experiment. Anything goes.

Whatever you do, a course must: 

1. Be hosted and described on your own website
2. Have a clearly defined admissions criteria (i.e prequisites and how to join)
3. Take place in the 6 weeks during a semester 
4. Contain links to the profiles of all those who participate in the course

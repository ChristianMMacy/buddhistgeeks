<Section legend="Why create a course?">

- Permission to do something weird 
- A community of people who care about learning
- Support structure
- Creating something valuable
- Make some money

</Section>

<Section legend="How?">

First, read the rest of this page to get an understanding of what kind of
courses we're looking for. 

Then, you can propose a course by creating a new
topic on in the [**Course
Kindergarten**](https://forum.hyperlink.academy/c/course-kindergarten/5). 

To start with this topic will be private. We'll take a look at it, chat back and
forth with you. Then, if we like it, we'll open it up for discussion to the
community, and get started implementing it!

If your course is accepted, you'll facilitate the first instance of it, at least.

<Section legend="Principles">

### Be ambitious

We're interested in _unreasonably effective learning_. Getting people together to
chat about a topic they're interested in is already a powerful learning
environment, so courses have to do better.

### Commitment to serious/deep/"meaningful"? learning

### Foster and celebrate kindness and generosity 

### Make those around you feel safe to confront the limits of their knowledge

</Section>

<Section legend="Constraints">

Courses on hyperlink.academy have to fit into specific constraints. 

### Courses must have a clear, explicit, measure of successful learning

### Learners must _do something_. 

### Courses must be reproducible by the community

### All course content and output must be Open Source

### Courses must cost X$

### Courses should pay for what they use

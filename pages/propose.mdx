<Section legend="How?">

First, read the rest of this page to get an understanding of what kind of
courses we're looking for. 

Then, you can propose a course by creating a new
topic on in the [**Course
Kindergarten**](https://forum.hyperlink.academy/c/course-kindergarten/5). 

To start with this topic will be private. We'll take a look at it, chat back and
forth with you. Then, if we like it, we'll open it up for discussion to the
community, and get started implementing it!

If your course is accepted, you'll facilitate the first instance of it.

<Section legend="Constraints">

Courses on hyperlink.academy have to fit into specific constraints. 

### Courses must be fallible

It doesn't matter _how_ a course measures learning, only that it does, in clear
an explicit terms. By the end of the course learners should have a clear
understanding of whether or not they accomplished what they set out to.

### Courses must be ambitious

We're interested in _unreasonably effective learning_. Getting people together to
chat about a topic they're interested in is already a powerful learning
environment, so courses have to do better.

### Learners must _do something_. 

Courses cannot be about gaining knowledge or building skills in the abstract.
Learners must take action.

### Courses mustn't depend on any specific individual

Courses aren't classrooms. They're not places for specific people to pass on
knowledge as teachers, but collaborative learning structures. That doesn't mean
that experienced individuals can't be a part of your course structure, just that
a _specific_ individual cannot.

### All content and resources courses use must be Open Source

All content explicitly used in a course must be open source and freely
accessible. This means that the content can grow over time from contributions,
and that all those who need it can have access.

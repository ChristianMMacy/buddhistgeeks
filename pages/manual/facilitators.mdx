# Facilitators

Facilitators lead cohorts of Hyperlink courses. They are participants, but are also guides, responsible for shaping the learning environment. If a course is a score and a cohort is a performance, the facilitator is the conductor.

## Getting Started

### Who Should Facilitate

We believe that powerful learning is possible between peers, and that very often leadership and structure matters more than specific expertise.

We want facilitation to be open to all — but keep in mind that it can be a lot of work! Before you apply, please be sure that you are:

1. **Prepared to commit fully to the role.** You will be compensated for your time, but make sure you have both space in your schedule *and* mental energy to give this work the full attention it requires.
2. **Qualified to facilitate a particular course**. We encourage courses to be designed such that any learner up for the challenge can facilitate a cohort. However, this depends a lot on the course, and some may require specific expertise to facilitate.

### The Perks of Facilitating

Facilitating a course has certain intrinsic benefits — for one, it can be a lot of fun; for two, it's a rewarding challenge — but comes with some concrete perks as well:

- **You will be compensated:** Facilitators should be paid fairly for their efforts. Hyperlink takes 20% of tuition (set at the course level), including payment processing fees. The other 80% goes straight to the facilitator.
- **You will learn *a lot:*** Facilitating a cohort (or several!) is a great way to explore a topic more deeply in a structured way, and shape the learning environment in service of particular learning goals.

### Becoming a Facilitator

1. If you're interested in facilitating a course cohort, reach out to a course maintainer by direct message on the forum ([email us](mailto:contact@hyperlink.academy) if you're not sure who to talk to). Be sure to mention:
    - The date range(s) in which you're available to facilitate
    - Any relevant qualifications, if needed
2. For now, we'll need to add you to the course as a ***maintainer***. One of the most important powers of a maintainer is the ability to create and facilitate new cohorts.
    - Eventually we may split out these powers so facilitating and maintaining are separated. For the time being, there's considerable overlap: different conceptual responsibilities, but same technical permissions on the site.
3. There are a couple technical details we'll need to take care of in order to pay you properly. Keep an eye out for an email with info on the following:
    - We use Stripe to handle both payments from learners, and payouts to facilitators. You'll need to make a Stripe account so that you can receive these payouts.
    - Hyperlink is technically hiring you as a contractor when you become a facilitator, so you'll also need to fill out a 1099 for tax purposes.

**Once these steps are complete, you'll have the ability to facilitate cohorts of the course!**

## Facilitating Cohorts

### Creating a New Cohort

1. Once you're a maintainer, you'll be able to edit course settings on the course page. From here, you can schedule and assign yourself to a new cohort.
2. When you first create the cohort, it will be in draft mode — not yet live and visible to the public. This gives you time to set up your cohort before publishing it to the world.
3. Navigate to your newly minted cohort page from the course page (or your homepage dashboard). There, you'll find a link to your cohort's private forum, which comes with some pre-populated posts you'll need to edit:
    - **The "Notes" topic**
        - Add details about the cohort's schedule. What dates and times you will be meeting? Where? The more specific, the better. (Include timezones!)
        - Add any amendments to the course curriculum. Are you switching out a reading or a meeting session? Trying a specific experiment? Mention it here.
        - ❗️**Important:** The contents of this post will automatically get published on the cohort page. That means it'll be publicly available for ANYONE, not just learners in this cohort, to see. Don't post anything you wouldn't want everyone to know (like links to video conference calls). All *other* topics in your cohort forum category are private to participants in this cohort. Note that each course also has its own publicly viewable forum.
    - **The "Getting Started" topic**
        - What should learners expect on day one? Are you kicking things off with a group meeting? Anything learners need to prepare before the cohort starts?
        - Spell out any important logistical details, and make sure to include links to video calls, assignments, or other things participants will need.
        - This is also a great place to encourage introductions!
    - **Anything Else…**
        - Are there other topics you'd like to create to get conversation going? Go ahead and create them here to kick off some conversations.
4. Once you're all set up, go back to the cohort page and click the "Go Live" button.

**Congrats, you've just created a cohort — get ready to facilitate!**

### Facilitating a Cohort

The specific shape of a facilitator's job is decided by the course curriculum. Below, we've outlined some general things you'll likely want to do as part of this process.

1. **Before the cohort**
    - Familiarize yourself with the course curriculum.
    - Set up your tools and resources: link to readings, schedule video calls, and set up any shared tools. Be sure to test before the cohort starts.
    - Chat with learners: as the start date approaches, participants will slowly start joining the forum. Say hi, answer any questions, and get to know everyone!
2. **During the cohort**
    - Keep things running smoothly, following the course curriculum. Common things you may be responsible for include scheduling video meetings, distributing reading materials or assignments, and facilitating conversations.
    - Put out fires if / when they happen. If something unexpected arises, be flexible and creative, and do your best to figure it out. We're here for you if you need help.
    - Lean on the Hyperlink community for support! As a facilitator you'll have access to a [private forum space](https://forum.hyperlink.academy/c/facilitator-lounge/30) for facilitators and maintainers. Use this to exchange advice and talk through any sticky situations.
3. **After the cohort**
    - Gather feedback and surface learning output, as a resource for the course. Two final discussion topics to make—
        - **Artifacts:** Every course on Hyperlink should result in learners producing some sort of artifact, whether an essay, final project, or research plan. Once the cohort is over, create a topic in the public course forum highlighting the artifact(s) that were produced.
        - **Retrospective:** Gather feedback from the learners and contribute your experience as a facilitator back to the course maintainers. What went well? What could be improved? We suggest starting a private discussion in the cohort forum, then summarizing the feedback in a topic on the public course forum.
    - Finally, mark your course as complete on the cohort page. The forum will always be open to you and members of the cohort, so feel free to stay and chat.
    - Get paid! Assuming all the necessary documentation is complete, you should see a deposit come in soon after the course completes.

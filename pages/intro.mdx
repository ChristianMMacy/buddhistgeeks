hyperlink.academy is an online university that lives in the links between
personal websites. Here we learn about the internet.

The structure is simple. Anyone is welcome to enroll as a learner, or to
facillitate a course, by submitting a link to be displayed on this page.

Anyone can be a learner, from full-time researchers, to people exploring on the
weekend. 

Courses can be about anything and have any structure! The only requirement for
both is that they happen on the internet.

By linking between this page, learners, and courses, we can create an internet
of learning!

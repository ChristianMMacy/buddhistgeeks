## Introductions

Replace with: brief note encouraging participants to introduce themselves in this topic. Something like:

Any other tools / services participants will need to sign up for or download (e.g. Google Drive, Zoom, etc.)? Materials to prepare? Be sure to let everyone know any preliminary action items.

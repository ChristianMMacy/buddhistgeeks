hyperlink.academy is a digital school experimenting with new models of
learning. 

It's built on open source software like [this
website](https://gitlab.com/jaredpereira/hyperlink-academy) and
[discourse](https://www.discourse.org/). You can fork, modify, and contribute to
any of it. 

It's composed of courses created by learners, and curated by the community. Each
course aims to create unreasonably effective learning. Courses are run in
independent instances, each supported by a facilitator.

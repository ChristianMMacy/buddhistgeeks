This is a template for a detailed description of this course — an overview of its entire curriculum. 

Please edit this topic to include most or all of the elements listed below!

Note that the following will be included on the course details page, and don't have to be added here:

- Title (max 50 characters)
- Short description (max 200 characters)
- Cost
- Requirements (short prerequisites)

## Course Goals

Replace with: a brief overview of what material the course covers, and its overall learning goals.

## Structure

Replace with: summary of how many sessions, how often you meet, estimate of time required, etc. You don't need a detailed schedule — you'll create an "event" for each meeting, per cohort.

## Syllabus / Schedule

Replace with: an outline of what will be covered in each week of the course (or whatever cadence you choose).

Note that this should be generalized e.g. "Week 1, Week 2…" — when the course is run, each cohort's schedule will include its specific dates and times.

## Artifacts

Replace with: tangible outcomes of the course — specific goals for final projects, evaluations, next steps, or any other specific output your course may produce.

## Who Should Sign Up

Replace with: further detail on prerequisites for the course, and description of its ideal participant — who would get the most out of this course? Who is it *not* for?

## Anything Else…

Replace with: anything else that you think is essential for participants to know! Feel free to rename this section or add additional ones as needed. Or if nothing comes to mind, simply remove this section.
